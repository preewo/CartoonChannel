            "description": "As Shaggy and Scooby are running away from a monster, Olympic Games organizer Diane watches Shaggy and Scooby's amazing running ability and asks them to join the 2012 World Invitational games (a parody of the 2012 Summer Olympics) in London. Shaggy accepts the offer, while Scooby is unable to join (because he is not human). Instead, Scooby-Doo becomes Shaggy's coach. The gang is flown on an all-expenses-paid trip to London so Shaggy can participate in the games. When they arrive, Daphne and Velma become interested in Steve Looker, an Olympic pole vaulter, causing Fred to want to become a pole vaulter in the games. The gang then goes to their hotel room, and Scooby hears a loud stomping noise outside while he is watching a Gladiatorsaurus marathon on TV. Shaggy and Scooby take a peek at what is going on, and find that a 2000-year-old Olympic statue has come to life and is terrorizing the city.",
