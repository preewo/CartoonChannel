    "overview": "\"The Pink Panther Show\" is the first series of the eponymous character, born as a result of the unforeseen success of the animated character that appeared in the credits of the Blake Edwards film. In principle, it was not conceived as a series, but rather shorts intended for cinemas, created by the same people responsible for the credits of the original Edwards film: the animators Friz Freleng (producer of those and character designer) and Hawley Pratt (their director). The episodes of this series are made up of three cartoons, two with the Pink Panther, and one with the Inspector, who is the cartoon version of the clumsy French detective played on film by Peter Sellers.",

After a series of mishaps caused to the contractor, he catches the Panther in the act, angrily chases him into a supply shed, and boards the door shut. The Pink Panther manages to disguise his \u201cpinkprints\u201d with blue stain, and slips them into the contractor's pocket from a hole in the shed door. The contractor seems to fall for it, and finishes the building. The Pink Panther sees his dream home, and is overjoyed; but just as he runs in, it is revealed that the Panther's new \u201chouse\u201d is actually the one that the contractor had initially intended to build.",
