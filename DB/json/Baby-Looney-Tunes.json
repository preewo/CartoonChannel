            "description": "The day before Easter, Granny reads the story of the Easter Bunny to her young Looney Tunes charges with predictable reactions: cynic Daffy scoffs at the notion; Sylvester, Tweety, Taz, and Lola are entranced; and Bugs is on the fence. A prolonged argument ensues, and during naptime the four youngest sneak out to search for the egg-bearing bunny. Thoughtful Bugs paints rocks to placate the younger ones, but on Easter morning all is well when the real Easter rabbit delivers the goodies. This hour-long movie is loaded with cheery songs, pastel colors, and a surprising number of teaching moments. With the exception of the ornery Daffy, this little band really watches out for one another.",
