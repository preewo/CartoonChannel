    "overview": "Mudsy was a ghost that haunted the Muddlemore mansion.  He slept in the grandfather clock and had never been woken up.  One day three teens turned the hands on the clock to 12 and when the clock started to bong. Mudsy woke up,  along with his cat Boo. The teens solve crimes and defeat bad guys.
